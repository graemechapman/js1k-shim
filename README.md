## Rules
- Not allowed to modify anything under `/shims`
- Not allowed to use any external includes
- No extra CSS/HTML or JS
- All code should be added to `src/app.js`

## Instructions
- Make sure you're running latest node
- Install `gulp` globally i.e. `npm install -g gulp`
- Run `yarn` to install all deps
- Add code to `src/app.js`, (remember you get three global vars already, see /shims/shim.html).
- Use `yarn run serve` to have a browser pop up that'll minify and show your app code running in the shim.
- Feel free to tweak the crusher variables under `Gulpfile.js`
